      <p>Jenn Turner is a writer and project coordinator at &amp;yet. Something about Github, something about Lanyrd and speaking, something about all the places she's written and also her podcast with Eric. Later, some stuff on her photos and when she has spare time she crochets or sleeps or hangs out on Meatspace. </p>
