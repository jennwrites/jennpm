      <p>Jenn Turner is a writer and project coordinator at <a href="https://andyet.com/team/jenn">&amp;yet</a>. Sometimes she plays with code and markdown on <a href="https://github.com/renrutnnej">GitHub</a>. Once in a while she helps at events or even <a href="http://lanyrd.com/profile/renrutnnej/">speaks</a>. She's tried writing a few times, and is finally pursuing her dream of chasing comedy with her pal Eric Zanol on the <a href="https://soundcloud.com/hashtagpodcast">hashtag podcast</a>. When she has spare time she crochets or sleeps or hangs out on <a href="https://chat.meatspac.es/">Meatspace</a>. </p>
